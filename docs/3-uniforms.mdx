## Chapter 3 - Uniforms

In [chapter 3 of the Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/02/) we are introduced to the concept of **uniform input**:

Shader pixels are rendered in parallel and each thread is "blind" to the others. To send input to these threads the input must be equal or "uniform" across all threads (and read only). Built-in uniforms exist for things like texture resolution, mouse input, and time.

Here are a few of "uniforms" in WebGL:

- `uniform vec2 u_resolution` - Width and height of the canvas.
- `uniform vec2 u_mouse` - Mouse x / y position.
- `uniform float u_time` - Time in seconds since the shader loaded.

The names of the built-in uniforms differ across implementations. Here are similar [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) equivalents:

- `uniform vec3 iResolution` - Viewport pixel resolution
- `uniform vec4 iMouse` - Mouse cordinates x/y and left/right mouse clicks z/w.
- `uniform float iTime` - Shader playback time in seconds.

Notice that the resolution and mouse uniforms are different dimensions depending on the implementation. This is important to know if you are porting code between implementations.

Check the [official GLSL Uniforms Wiki Docs](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Uniform_%28GLSL%29) for the nitty-gritty on this variable type.

In ShaderToy the uniforms are available by default, but with WebGL we need to specify them in our code, right after we specify the float precision:

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_mouse;
uniform float u_time;
```

## Varying Built-Ins

Along with uniforms there are also built-in _varying_ variables. In the previous chapter we saw the built-in output varying `gl_FragColor`, an `out` parameter of type `vec4` targetting the RGBA colour of each pixel.

**⚠️ Warning:** Apparently `gl_FragColor` is depreciated in current versions of the standard in favour of a manually defined output paramater. We can re-create `gl_FragColor` like so: `layout(location=0) out vec4 gl_FragCoord;` [Details](https://community.khronos.org/t/about-gl-fragcolor-of-fragment-shader/105102/3).

There is also a default output varying `in` parameter that specifies which x/y/z coordinates of the pixel the shader is working on called `gl_FragCoord`. [The official docs](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/gl_FragCoord.xhtml) shows its declaration as a 4D input paramater (`in vec4 gl_FragCoord ;`) defined as `(x, y, z, 1/w)`.

**🙋 Question:** I've only worked with `gl_FragCoord` so far in two dimensions `gl_FragCoord.xy`. What does it mean for a shader to have a z-index depth? And what the heck is `1/w`?

## Building a Colour Gradient Shader

Let create a Shader using the shader pixel varying `out` parameter `gl_FragColor` and the shader position varying `out` parameter `gl_FragCoord` along with the shader image-resolution `uniform` input parameter, `u_resolution`.

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform vec2 u_resolution;

// Color gradient based on a 2D coordinate.
// Takes a vec2 (x, y) coordinate. Returns a vec4 (r, g, b, a) color.
vec4 gradient(vec4 coord) {
  // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1) using the image
  // dimensions pulled from vec2 iResolution.
  vec2 uv = coord.xy / u_resolution.xy;

  // Return vec4 (r, g, b, a) with red gradated by the pixel's x coord.
  // Green, blue, and alpha are kept constant.
  return vec4(uv.x, 0.364, 0.499, 1.0);

  // Or, involve both the x and y axis:
  // return vec4(uv.x, uv.y, 0.499, 1.0);
}

// Function is automatically executed. Here it assigns a color to every pixel.
void main() {
  // Set the color of each pixel to a gradient based its coordinates.
  gl_FragColor = gradient(gl_FragCoord);
}

## Building a Dynamic Gradient Colur Shader

Here's a more complex shader that also plays with colour gradients but also involves the `u_mouse` and `u_time` uniforms.

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_mouse;
uniform float u_time;

// Sinusoidal function shifted and scaled to range betwen 0 and 1.
// See: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9jrdpvsmk
float sinEase(float x) {
  return 0.5 * sin(x) + 0.5;
}

void main() {
  // Set scale according to how far mouse is from left side.
  // 0.0 (full left) to 1.0 (full right)
  // Mouse coordinate is set when left-mouse-button is clicked.
  float blueRateScale = u_mouse.x / u_resolution.x;

  // Ease back and forth 1 and 100 using time-based sine.
  float stretchFactor = 99.0 * sinEase(u_time) + 1.0;

  // Setting red and green pixel value.
  // Ease back and forth between 0 and 1 based on pixel position
  // and time-based stretch factor.
  float red   = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.x / stretchFactor);
  float green = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.y / stretchFactor);

  // Blue will ease in and out based on time and the x position of the mouse.
  // Ease speed increases from left to right.
  float blue = abs(tan(u_time * blueRateScale));

  // Set the pixel value based on the RGB calculated above.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(red,green,blue,1);
}

### Trigonometric Rabbit Hole

_🎵 Shadertime, and the living is "Ease-y". 🎵_

This shader took me down a trig rabbit hole, chasing down a formula that would allow a gently transition, called an "ease", between 0.0 and 1.0 along a sinusoidal path. I used [this interactive sin plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9jrdpvsmk) to determine the answer. Sin normally transitions between -1 and +1, so we need to divide it by 2 (now transitioning between -0.5 and 0.5) and then add 0.5 (now transitioning between 0.0 and 1.0):

```glsl
float sinEase(float x) {
  return 0.5 * sin(x) + 0.5;
}
```

This `sinEase` function is used to ease R & G pixel colour strength according to pixel position in both x and y, creating what looks a bit like an interference pattern. The "width" of the colour easing sinusoid is stretched out from 1% to 99% according to the shader's playback time in seconds.

```glsl
  float stretchFactor = 99.0 * sinEase(u_time) + 1.0;
  float red   = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.x / stretchFactor);
  float green = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.y / stretchFactor);
```

The mouse's x position changes rate at which the Blue component strength eases between 0.0 and 1.0:

```glsl
float blue = abs(tan(u_time * blueRateScale));
```

I'm not sure why I went with the ridiculous function of [the absolute value of the tangent of the delta time](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w2oorqcxzm) for the blue easing.

## Graident Shader in Unreal Engine

Here's the above blue/pink gradient shader implemented as an Unreal Engine material using their node-base language:

![Unreal Graident Material Nodes](/img/3.0-unreal-gradient.jpg)

> [Copy these nodes to your clipboard to paste into Unreal Engine](https://blueprintue.com/blueprint/ryn-osf9/).

From "the outside" this material has percentage value (0.0 to 1.0) parameters for the material's `Metallic`, `Specular`, `Roughness`, and `Emissive Color`, properties.

In the GLSL shader the colours gradated by holding the Green and Blue component of every pixel constant (G = 36.4% intensity, B = 49.9% intensity), and changing the Red component with the x position of each pixel. The x position of the shader pixels is converted to a normalized range (0.0 to 1.0) by dividing actual x pixel position by the image resolution. From left to right the Red component of each pixels will increase from 0.0 (no red) to 1.0 (full stregth red).

```glsl
  vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / u_resolution.xy;

  // Return vec4 (r, g, b, a) with red gradated by the pixel's x coord.
  // Green, blue, and alpha are kept constant.
  return vec4(uv.x, 0.364, 0.499, 1.0); // Full alpha for all pixels
```

In the Unreal Material I used two colour nodes, represented in Unreal as two 4D constant vectors `Constant4Vector`: A blue shade (0, 0.364, 0.499) and a pink shade (1, 0.364. 0.499) with full alpha for both.

The `Lerp` node performs [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) on these two colour vectors, using the normalized x position of the material's `boundingBoxBased_0-1_UVW` as the position in the gradient between the two colours.

The lerpped colour is then used as the material's `Base Color` and is also optionally added as the material's `Emissive Color`. Lerping is another example of an easing function.

And here's a gif of this material applied to a simple sphere:
