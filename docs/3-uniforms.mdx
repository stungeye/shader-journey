## Chapter 3 - The Book of Shaders

The input "uniforms":

- iResolution
- iMouse
- iTime

Called uniforms as their values are equal across pixel threads.

## Example Shader Using Uniforms

import ResponsiveShader from "@theme/ResponsiveShader";
const shader =
  "precision mediump float; float sinEase(float x) { return 0.5 * sin(x) + 0.5; } uniform vec2 u_resolution; uniform vec2 u_mouse; uniform float u_time; void main() { float blueRateScale = u_mouse.x / u_resolution.x; float stretchFactor = 99.0 * sinEase(u_time) + 1.0; float red   = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.x / stretchFactor); float green = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.y / stretchFactor); float blue = abs(tan(u_time * blueRateScale)); gl_FragColor = vec4(red,green,blue,1); }";

<ResponsiveShader maxWidth="530" height="320" fragShader={shader} />

Trig functions are used to ease R & G by position and time. Mouse X position changes rate of B easing.

## The GLSL Code

The following GLSL code assumes a WebGL platform. A ShaderToy port of code written [can be seen here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3tscz7).

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

// Sinusoidal function shifted and scaled to range betwen 0 and 1.
// See: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9jrdpvsmk
float sinEase(float x) {
	return 0.5 * sin(x) + 0.5;
}

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_mouse;
uniform float u_time;

void main() {
    // Set scale according to how far mouse is from left side.
    // 0.0 (full left) to 1.0 (full right)
    // Mouse coordinate is set when left-mouse-button is clicked.
    float blueRateScale = u_mouse.x / u_resolution.x;

    // Ease back and forth 1 and 100 using time-based sine.
    float stretchFactor = 99.0 * sinEase(u_time) + 1.0;

    // Setting red and green pixel value.
    // Ease back and forth between 0 and 1 based on pixel position
    // and time-based stretch factor.
    float red   = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.x / stretchFactor);
    float green = sinEase( gl_FragCoord.y / stretchFactor);

    // Blue will ease in and out based on time and the x position of the mouse.
    // Ease speed increases from left to right.
    float blue = abs(tan(u_time * blueRateScale));

    // Set the pixel value based on the RGB calculated above.
    gl_FragColor = vec4(red,green,blue,1);
}
