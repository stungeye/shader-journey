## Chapter 4 - Running Your Shaders

In [chapter 4 of the Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/02/) we learn how to display and edit our shaders across different platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, Raspberry Pi, Browser).

## GLSL Viewers and Editors

In writting The Book of Shaders Patricio Gonzalez Vivo developed an ecosystem of GLSL-based tools for displaying and editing shaders:

- [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas) - Javascript library for displaying GLSL shaders on an HTML `canvas` element. GLSL source code is loaded from a URL or a string.
- [glslEditor](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslEditor) - In-browser fragment shader editor for GLSL. Uses the above glslCanvas for the built-in viewer.
- [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer) - Command line tool for GLSL shader generation / display. Think ImageMagick for shaders, but also hot-reloading viewer.
- [openframe](https://openframe.io/) - Open-source platform for digital art with support for HDMI display using RaspberryPi.

The glslEditor is lovely. Especially for its affordances like control widgets for live tweaking of vectors, numbers, and colours. You can play around with the editor at [editor.thebookofshaders.com](https://editor.thebookofshaders.com/). Although its ability to save to a URL and its integration to openframe.io seems to be broken due to [an SSL issue](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslEditor/issues/49).

There are a bunch of other Shader editors worth noting, many of which are also online communities for sharing Shader art:

- [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - Editor and community. I'll be creating ShaderToy ports for all my WebGL shaders.
- [Shaderoo](https://shaderoo.org/) - Similar editor and community.
- [ShaderFrog](https://shaderfrog.com) - Another similar editor and community, but this editor is node-based not GLSL. Includes the concept of "composed shaders", which are shaders composed out of multiple more basic sub-shaders.
- [ISF Editor](https://editor.isf.video/shaders/new) - Part of the open Interactive Shader Format for sharing GL shaders/metadata. The ability to create tweakable input parameters with a simple slider-based UI is nice! Also includes [a community](https://editor.isf.video/shaders).
- [ShaderFactory](https://shader-factory.herokuapp.com/) - Vertex and fragment shader editor for uniform UI.
- [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife) - Cross-platform real-time GPU shader editor, live-code performance tool and graphics prototyping sketchpad.
- [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) - Lightweight, cross-platform & full-featured desktop IDE for shaders. Supports both GLSL and [HLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Shading_Language) shaders.

I'm sure I'm missing a bunch, but that should do. üòù
