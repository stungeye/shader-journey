## Chapter 2 - Hello World

In [chapter 2 of the Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/02/) we are introduced to the GLSL shading language:

- GLSL is based on the C programming language. Some of the similarities and differences [can be seen here](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_%28GLSL%29).
- Like C, every GLSL has a `void main()` function that is automatically invoked.
- The standard C primitive types are availabe like `float`, `int`, and `bool`, but we also get new built-in types like those for 2d, 3d, and 4d vectors (`vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`).
- The vector types group 2, 3 or 4 normalized floats (range 0.0 to 1.0). A common use for `vec4` is to represent a colour with a R, G, B and alpha value.
- Floating point precision can be specified. Lower precision means higher speeds at the cost of quality:
  - `precision lowp float;`
  - `precision mediump float;`
  - `precision highp float;`
- C-style preprocessor macro are also available for `#define`-ing globals and pre-compile conditional (`#ifdef` / `#endif`).
- The built in variable `gl_Fragcolor` represents the colour that will be assigned to every pixel in your image.

## Example Shader

Let's write a simple shader that assigns every pixel in our image the colour red:

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

void main() {
  // Set the color of each pixel to red.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(1., 0., 0., 1.);
}

```

## Shader Output

import ResponsiveShader from "@theme/ResponsiveShader";

<ResponsiveShader
  maxWidth="530"
  height="320"
  fragShaderPath="/shaders/2.0-hello-world.frag"
/>

Depending on the implementation GLSL variables will not always auto-cast.

So the following version of our all red shader might not work:

```glsl
void main() {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(1, 0, 0, 0); // Some implementation may not cast these ints to floats.
}
```
